Set a number of your choice.
Wait for the opponent to select their number.
Guess the opponent's number and opponent will do the same other way around.
The game engine will compare the original number and the guessed number and counter it.
For example.

If opponent's number is 123 and player guesses 356.
In this case, the game engine will inform the player : Y0 N1.
Here, 3 exists in the original number but it's position is incorrect.
Hence, N is 1.

Now player guesses 528.
Game engine will inform : Y1 N0.
As 2 is in the correct position, Y is sent as 1.

The player who guesses the number first, wins.
